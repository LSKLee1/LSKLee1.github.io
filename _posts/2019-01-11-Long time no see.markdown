> “Hei, How are you? ”

Hey! I know we haven't seen each other, or even talked to each other in a while. 

But I want you to know, that I've been doing a lot of thinking lately and I want you to know that I MISS YOU! 

Not that I regret what happened or that I want to see you again, just I MISS YOU! 

It's so strange to think, that someone I knew ,so well , is now a total stranger to me that sometimes I go entire days without thinking about you. 
The rest of the time I let myself forget because it's easier but then I find something, a photo, a gift, the silly love letters 
when I was in the classroom we sent to each other and The full weight of what's being lost crashing down on me. Part of me wants to see you again, to hold you, to kiss you. 
But all of those feelings become empty thoughts. when I look back now, remembering that LOVE isn't always what it seems. It's just so easy to forget. This isn't regret.
We had our reasons for ending it and they were as valid as ever. But back at the start we didn't need any reasons to fall in love, WE JUST DID!!!! 
The reasons came at the end and everything since then has become about reasons and that's good, it means that one day I'll find someone who I won't have to say goodbye too but apart of me just loves missing someone and having them love you back.

That's all. 
What I'm saying is I hope everything is good with you, I hope everything is great! I hope you've found a love that's all the things ours couldn't be. But just a small part of me hopes that you still remember what it was like before all the reasons and that you MISS ME TOO!!!!
