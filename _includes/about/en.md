Hello, I am *@Reno* (Sikuan Li), a student who wanna to be a data scientist or maybe a  software enginner. I am currently working on IELTS, and preparing for studying abroad. I must be happy to go to crazy if I receive the offer of [Durham University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Durham_University)(Emm, of course, [KCL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King%27s_College_London)is also okay).

I am pursuing BS in Software Engineering(international) and studied in [Northeastern University (China)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northeastern_University_(China)) since 2017.
